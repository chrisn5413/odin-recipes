# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website created for The Odin Project.

This project showcases the basics I have learned about html and 
how they can be used in tandem to create a simple website.

The main page consists of 3 links which lead to recipes I found 
on Allrecipes.com.The first one was found on the mainpage while
the others I took some time locating basic sides.

Each recipe webpage follows the same structure: Title, Image, 
Description, Ingredients, and Steps. All information for each 
category was taken from Allrecipes.com.

I also took the liberty of including a back button to get back
to the index (for testing purposes mainly but also convenience).
